[Verse 1]
I'll smile, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
Keep my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2]
Breakdown, only alone I will cry out loud
You'll never see what's hiding out
Hiding out deep down, yeah-yeah
I know, I've heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I'm too afraid now, yeah
